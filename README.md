 🫁 **Lung Disease Classification: Respirx**

This project offers an automated solution for lung disease detection using a deep learning model (**EfficientNetB0**) and a real-time web interface.

🔍 **It classifies chest X-ray images into:**
- **COVID-19**
- **NORMAL**
- **PNEUMONIA**
- **TUBERCULOSIS**

---

## 🚀 **Features**
- **EfficientNetB0 Backbone:** Lightweight and powerful transfer learning model.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Upload X-rays via a simple Flask web app.
- **Early Stopping:** Prevents overfitting during training.
- **Training Visualization:** Live plots for accuracy and loss.
- **Modular Codebase:** Easy to modify or expand.

---

## 🌟 **Future Improvements**
- **Add Grad-CAM heatmaps** for explainable predictions.
- **Expand to more lung diseases.**
- **Deploy on cloud platforms** for wider access.
